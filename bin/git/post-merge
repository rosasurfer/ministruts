# Git hook to run "composer install" if the file "composer.lock" was changed.
#
# Notes:
# ------
#  - This hook is not executed by Eclipse.

#  - The hook is not executed if merging failed due to conflicts.
#  - The hook is not executed if you run pull with --rebase option.
#
#  - post-rewrite works for me. As side effect it is also executed on amend.
#    @see  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21307744/git-post-rebase-hook
#
#  - I would check updated submodules too:
#    check_run .gitmodules "git submodule init && git submodule update"
