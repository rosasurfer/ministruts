conditions are met:

* If you redistribute the source code, it must include a copy of this
  fucking license. You can't fucking remove this license from the source.
  It fucking stays or I will fucking hurt you.
* If you redistribute in binary form, the same goes. Put a fucking copy
  of this license in the fucking documentation or something. People
  need to read this shit.
* And no, you fucking well can't use the name of the author to endorse
  or promote your shitty software or products. Seriously, why the fuck
  would you do that anyway?

This software is provided "as fucking is". Oh, you want a warranty?
Oh, you think just by getting hold of this shit implies a warranty,
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose? You think your
fucking lame "SAAS" website is going to make you a millionaire, and you
want to blame me if shit goes whack? Well fuck you! It fucking well does
not! I totally disclaim any of that shit. Listen hard: There is no
fucking way that I will be held liable for any of the crap you want to
try and pin on me:
  1. I disclaim damages of any type - direct, indirect, incidental,
     special,  exemplary, or consequential. Who the fuck knew that there
     were so many types of damages? And yet here I am disclaiming them
     all.
  2. If you use this software and end up having to buy new shit, or
     hire some acne-ridden nerd to fix stuff that went wrong, or if
     shit gets fucked up so bad you have downtime, wipe your data,
     lose profits, or suddenly can't access reddit.com, I don't
     fucking care and it's not my fault. Consider it all disclaimed,
     muthafucker.
  3. I don't give a shit if you have some fucking "theory" of
     liability. Your theory of liability is not going to save your ass.
     You know why? Because I'm fucking disclaiming liability right
     here; right now. That includes contract, strict liability, or tort
     (including negligence or otherwise) and that applies to all the
     damages I mentioned above. Even if I fucking told you. Even if I
     said "Hey, if you use this software, your computer will blow up".
     which it might.

The fucking end
