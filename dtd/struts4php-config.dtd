     DTD for the Struts for PHP Application Configuration File

     To support validation of your configuration file, include the following
     DOCTYPE element at the beginning (after the "xml" declaration):

     <!DOCTYPE php-struts-config SYSTEM "dtd/struts4php-config.dtd">

<!-- ========== Defined Types ============================================= -->


<!-- A "Boolean" is the string representation of a boolean (true or false) 
     variable.    
-->

<!ENTITY % Boolean "(true|false)">


<!-- A "ClassName" is the simple name of a PHP class that is instantiated to 
     provide the functionality of the enclosing element.
-->
<!ENTITY % ClassName "CDATA">


<!-- An "Integer" is a character string consisting solely of numeric digits,
     optionally preceeded by a minus sign, that can be converted to a
     32-bit integer.
-->
<!ENTITY % Integer "CDATA">


<!-- A "Location" is a relative path, delimited by "/" characters, that
     defines the location of a resource relative to the location of the
     Struts4PHP configuration file itself.
-->
<!ENTITY % Location "#PCDATA">


<!-- A "PropertyName" is the name of a class property, and must begin with
     a lower case letter and contain only characters that are legal in a
     PHP identifier.
-->
<!ENTITY % PropertyName "CDATA">


<!-- A "RequestPath" is a module-relative URI path, beginning with a
     slash "/", that identifies a mapped resource within this web application.
-->
<!ENTITY % RequestPath "CDATA">


<!-- A "RequestType" identifies a request type.
-->
<!ENTITY % RequestType "(get|post)">



<!-- ========== Top Level Elements ======================================== -->


<!-- The "php-struts-config" element is the root of the configuration file hierarchy, 
     and contains nested elements for all of the other configuration settings.
-->
<!ELEMENT struts-config (global-forwards?, action-mappings?)>
<!ATTLIST struts-config  id             ID              #IMPLIED>


<!-- The "global-forwards" element describes a set of ActionForward objects that are 
     available to all Action objects as a return value. The individual ActionForwards 
     are configured through nested <forward> elements. An <action> element may override 
     a global forward by defining a local <forward> of the same name.
-->
<!ELEMENT global-forwards (forward*)>
<!ATTLIST global-forwards id            ID              #IMPLIED>


<!-- The "forward" element describes an ActionForward that is to be made available to 
     an Action as a return value. An ActionForward is referenced by a logical name and 
     encapsulates a URI. A "forward" element may be used to describe both global and 
     local ActionForwards. Global forwards are available to all the Action objects in 
     the module. Local forwards can be nested within a <mapping> element and are only 
     available to an Action object when it is invoked through that ActionMapping.

     name           The unique identifier for this forward. Referenced by the Action 
                    object at runtime to select - by its logical name - the resource 
                    that should complete the request/response.

     include        The identifier of the resource that is encapsulated by the logical 
                    name of this ActionForward.  If the value begins with a slash "/" 
                    character it is interpreted as the path to a physical resource.
                    If it doesn't begin with a slash "/" character it is interpreted as 
                    the class name of a layout subclass [TilesLayout].  Exactly one of 
                    "include", "redirect" or "alias" must be specified.
                    
     redirect       The module-relative path of the location to which a redirect 
                    instruction should be issued.  If the value of a local ActionForward 
                    (nested within a <mapping> element) is "__self" the redirect 
                    instruction is issued to the location identified by the path attribute 
                    of the enclosing <mapping> element.  Exactly one of "include", 
                    "redirect"  or "alias" must be specified.

     alias          The unique identifier of another ActionForward to use instead.  
                    Used to simplify the configuration.  Exactly one of "include", 
                    "redirect" or "alias" must be specified.

<!-- The "action-mappings" element describes a set of ActionMapping objects
     that are available to process requests matching the given url-pattern. 
     The individual ActionMappings are configured through nested
     <action> elements. 
-->
<!ELEMENT action-mappings (mapping*)>
<!ATTLIST action-mappings id             ID              #IMPLIED>


<!-- The "mapping" element describes an ActionMapping object that is to be used
     to process a request for a specific module-relative URI. The following
     attributes are defined:

     path            The module-relative path of the submitted request, starting
                     with a "/" character, and without the filename extension if
                     extension mapping is used.

                     NOTE:  Do *not* include a period in your path name,
                     because it will look like a filename extension and
                     cause your Action to not be located.

     forward         Module-relative path of the resource that will process this 
                     request, instead of the Action class specified by "type".  
                     The path WILL NOT be processed through the "forwardPattern" 
                     attribute that is configured on the "controller" element for 
                     this module. Exactly one of "forward" or "type" must be
                     specified.

     action          Class name of the action subclass [Action] that will process 
                     requests for this action mapping. Not valid if the "forward" 
                     attribute is specified.  Exactly one of "forward" or "type" 
                     must be specified.

     form            Class name of the action form subclass [ActionForm],
                     if any, that is associated with this action mapping.

     parameter       General-purpose configuration parameter that can be used to
                     pass extra information to the Action object selected by
                     this action mapping.

     roles           Comma-delimited list of role names that are allowed access 
                     to this ActionMapping object.

     method          The request type that this ActionMapping may be restricted to. 
                     Legal values are "get" and "post".
                     [no restriction]

     default         Set to "true" if this object should be configured as the
                     default action mapping for this module. If a request does not
                     match another object, it will be passed to the ActionMapping
                     object with default set to "true". Only one ActionMapping
                     object can be marked as "default" within a module.

<!-- ========== Subordinate Elements ====================================== -->


<!-- The "set-property" element specifies the method name and initial value of
     an additional class configuration property. When the object representing
     the surrounding element is instantiated, the accessor for the indicated
     property is called and passed the indicated value. The "set-property"
     element is especially useful when a custom subclass is used with
     <forward> or <mapping> elements. The subclass can be passed whatever other 
     properties may be required to configure the object without changing how 
     the struts4p-config is parsed.

     property        Name of the class property whose setter method will be 
                     called.

     value           String representation of the value to which this
                     property will be set, after suitable type conversion
